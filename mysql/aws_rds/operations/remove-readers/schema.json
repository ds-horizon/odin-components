Remove readers to reduce costs during periods of low read demand or to decommission over-provisioned capacity. Specify instance type and count to target specific readers for removal. `Impact:` Removing readers reduces read capacity and may impact query performance if remaining readers cannot handle the load. `Production:` Remove readers during low-traffic periods and monitor read latency metrics closely. Always maintain at least one reader for high availability.",
