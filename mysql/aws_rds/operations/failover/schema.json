Triggering a failover is needed to test disaster recovery procedures, perform maintenance on the current primary instance, validate application failover handling, or recover from primary instance issues. `Impact:` Causes brief connection interruption (typically 30-120 seconds), triggers DNS endpoint updates, may cause temporary replication lag, and requires applications to reconnect. During failover, write operations will fail until the new primary is ready. `Production:` Always test failover procedures in non-production environments first, ensure applications have proper connection retry logic with exponential backoff, schedule during low-traffic periods when possible, verify monitoring and alerting are in place, and confirm the target reader instance is in sync before initiating failover."
