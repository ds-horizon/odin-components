Rebooting is necessary when parameter changes require a restart, to clear database cache, or to resolve performance degradation. `Impact:` Causes temporary downtime (typically 1-5 minutes), drops all active database connections. `Production:` Always schedule reboots during maintenance windows, notify dependent services beforehand, ensure application retry logic is in place, and avoid rebooting multiple instances simultaneously in clustered environments."
